    "### Deep Learning Features - An Alternative to ``Bag of Words``\n",
    "\n",
    "As we have discussed in class, another powerful method for scene classification in computer vision is the employment of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) - sometimes referred to generically as $deep learning$. It is important to understand how previously trained (pretrained) networks can be used as another form of feature extraction, and how they relate to classical Bag of Words (BoW) features. We will be covering details on how one chooses the network architecture and training procedures later in the course. For this question, however, we will be asking you to deal with the VGG-16 pretrained network. VGG-16 is a pretrained Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) that has been trained on approximately 1.2 million images from the ImageNet Dataset (``http://image-net.org/index``) by the Visual Geometry Group (VGG) at University of Oxford. The model can classify images into a 1000 object categories (e.g. keyboard, mouse, coffee mug, pencil).\n",
    "\n",
    "One lesson we want you to take away from this exercise is to understand the effectiveness of $deep$ $features$ for general classification tasks within computer vision - even when those features have been previously trained on a different dataset (i.e. ImageNet) and task (i.e. object recognition).
